# ArduinoPhMeter (PHMetro)

This project is build up a Arduino based portable device for Prolonged esophageal pH-metry.

Hardware that you should need is :
  -  Arduino MEGA
  -  LCD Keypad Shield
  -  Bluetooh Module (HC-05)
  -  Gyroscope Module (not implemented)
  -  RTC Module
  -  MicroSD Card Module
  -  2x PH Meter Board
  -  3D Printed Case (not implemented)

Feature :
  - Show real time PH reading.
  - Use keypad for enter "Calibration Mode" for read the PH reading for PH calibration.
  
  - Serial Port communication via Arduino MEGA USB port, send command to MEGA for get back the PH reading.
